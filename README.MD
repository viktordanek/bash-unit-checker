Sure! Here’s a structured `README.md` that describes your Nix flake clearly and provides instructions for usage.

# Flake: Observed vs Expected Comparison using Bash Unit

This Nix flake provides a framework for comparing **expected outputs** with **observed values** generated dynamically from a given derivation. The comparison leverages `bash_unit` for lightweight unit testing and allows users to store results for easy inspection.

## Features

- **Integration with bash_unit** for testing.
- Generates **observed values** based on a provided derivation.
- Compares expected and observed outputs and stores the results.
- Designed for modular use with other flakes.

## Usage

To use this flake, you’ll need to:

1. **Generate an expected directory** in your own flake. This directory should contain the outputs that you expect.
2. **Pass the expected directory's name** and a function for generating the **observed values** to this flake.
3. This flake will **compare** the expected vs. observed values and **store the comparison results**.

---

## Installation

Add this flake as an input to your own Nix flake:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    comparison-flake.url = "github:your-org/your-comparison-flake";
  };

  outputs = { self, comparison-flake, ... }:
    # Use the comparison logic as needed
    {};
}
```

Make sure you have the necessary `bash_unit` dependency available. If it’s not already part of your system or project, you can import it from `nixpkgs`:

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, ... }: {
    bash_unit = nixpkgs.lib.bashUnit;
  };
}
```

---

## Configuration

Here is an overview of the expected configuration:

1. **Expected Directory**  
   This directory contains the outputs you expect to see. Ensure this directory is available before invoking the comparison logic.

2. **Observed Value Generator Function**  
   The function you provide should take a **derivation** as input and generate the observed output for comparison. This function will be called during the test run.

3. **Result Storage**  
   The comparison results will be stored in a directory, allowing you to review any mismatches between expected and observed values.

---

## Example

Below is a simple usage example to help you get started.

### Example Directory Structure

```bash
my-flake/
├── flake.nix
├── expected-output/
│   └── output.txt
```

### Example Flake Configuration

In your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  description = "A flake comparing observed and expected values.";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
    comparison-flake.url = "github:your-org/your-comparison-flake";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, comparison-flake }: {
    # Define an observed value generator function
    generateObserved = { drv }: ''
      mkdir -p observed-output
      echo "Generated output from $drv" > observed-output/output.txt
    '';

    # Use the comparison flake to run the comparison
    defaultPackage.x86_64-linux = comparison-flake.lib.runComparison {
      expectedDir = ./expected-output;
      generateObserved = generateObserved;
    };
  };
}
```

Run the comparison using:

```bash
nix run .#defaultPackage
```

This will compare the files in `expected-output/` with those generated by your function and store the results for review.
